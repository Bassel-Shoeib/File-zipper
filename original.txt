In the heart of the city, where the towering skyscrapers kissed the clouds and the streets pulsed with life,
a quiet revolution was unfolding. Beneath the noise of traffic and chatter,
digital data zipped invisibly through fiber-optic veins, encoding moments, memories, and messages into compact streams of bits.
Efficiency was paramount; every byte mattered. Huffman coding, a clever algorithm devised in the mid-20th century,
found new purpose in this modern maze of information. From compressing ancient texts to streaming high-definition videos,
its impact rippled silently through the circuits of civilization. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting amber light on glass and steel,
the code worked tirelessly â€” unseen, unsung, but indispensable.
